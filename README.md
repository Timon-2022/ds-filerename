# ü§ñ Ollama File Renamer

Effortlessly rename files using local AI - No tokens, No API, No cost!

## ‚ú® What is This?

A dead-simple Python script that uses Ollama to automatically rename your files based on their content. Perfect for developers, writers, and anyone drowning in messy file names.

## üöÄ Why Use This?

- **Free:** 100% local AI, no external services
- **Simple:** Just run `python rename_files.py path\to\folder`
- **Smart:** AI understands your file content
- **Safe:** Original files saved in `backup_<timestamp>/` directory
- **Fast:** Works with hundreds of files quickly-ish, with optional parallel processing
- **Configurable:** Interactively choose directory, file pattern, model from ollama api, and context length
- **Robust:** Error handling and comprehensive logging

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (Free, local AI)

## üíæ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/octrow/ollama-rename-files.git
cd ollama-rename-files

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Pull a small language model (optional, the script will prompt you to choose)
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Interactive mode (prompts for directory, pattern, model)
```bash
python rename_files.py
```

### CLI mode (`-d`)
```bash
# Rename files in specific directory
python rename_files.py -d "C:\path\to\your\folder"

# Specify path, model and context length
python rename_files.py -d "your_folder" -m "qwen2.5-coder:7b" -c 500

# CLI with directory and file pattern (no prompts)
python rename_files.py -a -d "your_folder" --prefix "new" --ext ".txt"

# Parallel processing (rename 4 files at a time)
python rename_files.py -d "your_folder" -p 4
```

## ü§î How It Works

1. Try to run `python rename_files.py`, answer the questions!
2. Optionally, prompts for directory, file pattern (prefix and extension), and Ollama model.
3. Finds files matching the specified pattern.
4. Creates a backup directory named backup_<timestamp>.
5. Backs up each file to the backup directory.
6. Uses local Ollama AI to read file content (up to the specified context length).
7. Generates a smart, descriptive filename based on the content.
8. Renames the file.
9. Logs every action.

## üìã Naming Convention

Creates filenames like:
- `task-fix-backend-resolve-database-connection-issue.txt`
- `doc-update-project-architecture-notes.md`

## üõ°Ô∏è What's Protected?

- Original files are backed up before renaming.
- Comprehensive logging
- Error-resistant design with detailed error messages.
- Works with hundreds of files, sequentially or in parallel.
